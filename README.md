# lsr
Command lsr prints a recursive listing of the current directory, including
quoted filename, size, modtime, and sha256(contents).

This is a minor variation of a command I've been using since the early '80s
to organize backups, mirror projects, and check for filesystem corruption.
Its use in administering netlib is described in ACM TOMS (1995) 21:1:89-97.
